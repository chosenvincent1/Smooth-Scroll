            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Cross device testing is the process that involves evaluating the functionality, usability, and visual uniformity of mobile applications on different types of devices. Its main objective is to ensure a consistent user experience, no matter which device is in use. This testing method considers differences in screen sizes, resolutions, device types, and operating systems, among other variables.</p>

            <p>Considering such variables in the test process is important to ensure a seamless user experience across different devices in the market. If we look at the statistics, by 2025, the number of mobile devices is expected to reach 18.22 billion, indicating an increase of 4.2 billion devices compared to 2020. In 2022, the global count of smartphone mobile network subscriptions reached 6.4 billion; forecasts project it to exceed 7.7 billion by 2028.</p>

            <h2>Cross Device Testing on the Cloud</h2>

            <p>To perform mobile application testing across multiple devices, managing the infrastructure of the latest devices, operating systems, browsers, and their respective versions becomes essential. This can be quite cumbersome, demanding a dedicated team for effective management, not to mention its considerable financial overhead. Furthermore, the process is time-intensive and often encounters scalability issues.</p>

            <p>During real device cloud testing, you can access essential debugging tools such as network logs, device logs, app logs, videos, and screenshots, providing comprehensive insights into your app's performance. Testing your apps is a breeze â€“ simply upload the .abb, .apk, or .ipa files. You can also install production apps directly from the Google Play Store or App Store.</p>
